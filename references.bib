Identifying clusters can be achieved by optimizing a fitness function that measures the quality of a cluster within the graph. Examples of such cluster measures include the conductance, the local and relative densities, and single cluster editing. We prove that the decision problems associated with the optimization tasks of finding clusters that are optimal with respect to these fitness measures are NP-complete.",

    abstract = {Motivation: Incorporating biological prior knowledge into predictive models is a challenging data integration problem in analyzing high-dimensional genomic data. We introduce a hypergraph-based semi-supervised learning algorithm called HyperPrior to classify gene expression and array-based comparative genomic hybridization (arrayCGH) data using biological knowledge as constraints on graph-based learning. HyperPrior is a robust two-step iterative method that alternatively finds the optimal labeling of the samples and the optimal weighting of the features, guided by constraints encoding prior knowledge. The prior knowledge for analyzing gene expression data is that cancer-related genes tend to interact with each other in a protein–protein interaction network. Similarly, the prior knowledge for analyzing arrayCGH data is that probes that are spatially nearby in their layout along the chromosomes tend to be involved in the same amplification or deletion event. Based on the prior knowledge, HyperPrior imposes a consistent weighting of the correlated genomic features in graph-based learning.Results: We applied HyperPrior to test two arrayCGH datasets and two gene expression datasets for both cancer classification and biomarker identification. On all the datasets, HyperPrior achieved competitive classification performance, compared with SVMs and the other baselines utilizing the same prior knowledge. HyperPrior also identified several discriminative regions on chromosomes and discriminative subnetworks in the PPI, both of which contain cancer-related genomic elements. Our results suggest that HyperPrior is promising in utilizing biological prior knowledge to achieve better classification performance and more biologically interpretable findings in gene expression and arrayCGH data.Availability:  http://compbio.cs.umn.edu/HyperPriorContact:  kuang@cs.umn.eduSupplementary information:  Supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online.},

 abstract = {The heat kernel is a type of graph diffusion that, like the much-used personalized PageRank diffusion, is useful in identifying a community nearby a starting seed node. We present the first deterministic, local algorithm to compute this diffusion and use that algorithm to study the communities that it produces. Our algorithm is formally a relaxation method for solving a linear system to estimate the matrix exponential in a degree-weighted norm. We prove that this algorithm stays localized in a large graph and has a worst-case constant runtime that depends only on the parameters of the diffusion, not the size of the graph. On large graphs, our experiments indicate that the communities produced by this method have better conductance than those produced by PageRank, although they take slightly longer to compute. On a real-world community identification task, the heat kernel communities perform better than those from the PageRank diffusion.},
